This simple ruptime implementation runs on linux based computers.

Run make after cloning this repository on computers you wish to behave as client and servers. This will generate the executables 
for both server and client.

Execute the server codes on the PCs you want to behave as servers first. Enter the IP address (or hostname) of computer you're 
running the server code(ruptimeServer) on, on the command line itself. For example:

On computer 1 (behaving as server):
./ruptimeServer 191.191.191.191

On computer 2 (also behaving as server):
./ruptimeServer 192.192.192.192
 
Now execute the client code on the PC you want to behave as a client. Please enter the IP address (or hostname) of servers 
(on which the server code, i.e ruptimeServer is running) 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. how many ever you want (2 servers in example above)
on command line with client code(ruptimeClient). For example:

On client computer:
./ruptimeClient 191.191.191.191 192.192.192.192
